# Why is statistics a required course?

---

# Psychological Facts & Theories

Psychological science produces facts and theories.

--

1. "Facts" are produced by collecting measurements about psychological phenomena, and by  running experiments to establish the root causes of the phenomena

--

2. "Theories" are working explanations of a set of facts, they describe how causal forces work to produce the psychological phenomena

---

# Facts depend on Evidence

1. "Facts" about psychology are only as good as the evidence for them. 

   a. Facts can be relied upon when the evidence for their existence is indispustable (clear-cut). There are many reliable findings in Psychology.
   
2. You **should not** believe every fact you hear!

   a. Many findings in psychology are unreliable (other researchers can't reproduce them), some are faked! and, others are downright silly.

# Theories must explain evidence

The whole point of theories is to explain evidence, or the credible facts about a psychological phenomena of interest

1. There are many good, strong, theories in Psychology capable of explaining many aspects of Psychological phenomena, BUT:

2. You **should not** believe every theory you hear about in Psychology! Many "theories" do not explain the facts. Some "theories" aren't theories at all, they are just someone's opinion.

# Umm, How can we trust the facts and theories in Psychology?

## You need to learn how to evaluate **the evidence** 

---

# All Psychology needs statistics

1. Psychologists run experiments to test research questions and claims

--

2. The experiments produce measurements, or evidence
--

3. Statistics are used to evaluate the evidence

--

  a. Does the evidence support the claim?
    
--

  b. Does the evidence not support the claim?


---

# When you hear a scientific claim...

1. You could accept the claim because "a Scientist said it was true"

2. You could evaluate the evidence for claim and decide for yourself if the evidence warrants the claim.

**Just because a scientist makes a claim, doesn't make it true**

# The case of power-posing

---

# Can a powerful pose change your life?

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/1apowerpose1.png")
```

---

# High vs. low power poses

```{r, out.width=300, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/1apowerpose2.png")
```

---

# The "evidence"

```{r, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/1apowerpose3.png")
```

---

# Big claims gone public

Amy Cuddy gave a TED Talk (viewed by 48 million people) claiming power posing can change your life!

```{r, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/1apowerpose4.png")
```


---

# The problem: it was fake news

1. Only a single study, with weak evidence
2. Many other labs tried to reproduce the findings, but **they failed to replicate**

**Lesson 1**: Don't believe everything you hear just because Science says so.

**Lesson 2**: To understand Psychological science, you must understand how to evaluate evidence produced by Psychological science.
