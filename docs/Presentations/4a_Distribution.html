# Chance does things

---

# Big ideas for this course

1. Psychology interpets patterns in data to draw conclusions about psychological processes

--

2. Chance can produce "patterns" in data

--

3. **Problem**: How can we know if the pattern is real, or simply a random accident produced by chance

---

# Solutions

1. Need to understand what chance is

--

2. Need to find out what chance can actually do in a particular situation

--

3. Create tools to help us determine whether chance was likely or unlikely to produce patterns in the data

---

# Issues for this class

1. **Probability Basics** 

2. **Distributions**

3. **Sampling from distributions**

# Probability Basics

---

# What is a probability?

- A number bounded between 0 and 1

- Describes the "chances" or "likelihood" of an event

---

# Proportions and Percentages

- Percentage (%) : A ratio between event frequency, and total frequency, expressed in units of 100.
- Proportion : a decimal version (range between 0-1)

`\(100\% = \frac{100}{100} = 1 = 1*100 = 100\%\)`

`\(50\% = \frac{50}{100} = .5 = .5*100 = 50\%\)`

`\(\frac{2}{4} = .5 = .5*100 = 50\%\)`

---

# Two probability statements

- A coin has a 50% chance of landing heads

  - p(heads) = .5

--

- There is a 10% chance of rain tomorrow
  - p(rain tomorrow) = .1

---

# Frequentist vs. Bayesian

Probability is defined differently depending on philosophical tradition.

1. Frequentist: The long-run chances (odds) of an event occurring

2. Bayesian: Degree of belief

---

# A fair coin

A fair coin has a 50% chance of landing heads or tails

- Frequentist: If you flip this coin an infinity of times, **in the long run** half of the outcome will be heads, and half will be tails

- Bayesian: I am uncertain about the outcome, I can't predict what it will be.

---

# 10% chance of rain tomorrow

10% chance of rain tomorrow refers to a single event that hasn't yet occurred

- Frequentist: I don't know what to say. Tomorrow it will rain or not rain, so there will be a 0% or 100% chance of rain, we'll find out after tomorrow happens

- Bayesian: It is unlikely to rain tomorrow, I won't bring an umbrella.

# 50% chance

# Coin flipping

I made R flip a fair coin 100 times:


```
##       [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]
##  [1,] "H"  "H"  "T"  "T"  "H"  "H"  "H"  "T"  "H"  "T"  
##  [2,] "T"  "H"  "T"  "H"  "H"  "H"  "H"  "H"  "T"  "H"  
##  [3,] "H"  "H"  "H"  "T"  "T"  "T"  "H"  "T"  "H"  "T"  
##  [4,] "T"  "T"  "H"  "T"  "H"  "H"  "T"  "T"  "H"  "T"  
##  [5,] "H"  "T"  "T"  "H"  "T"  "T"  "H"  "H"  "T"  "T"

# coin flipping summary

1. 50% heads/tails means that **over the long run**, you should get half heads and half tails

2. When sample size (number of flips) is small, you can "randomly" get more or less than 50% heads

3. Chance is lumpy

---

# Discrete probability distributions

1. Defines the probability of each item in a set. 
2. All probabilities must add up to 1

class: pink, center, middle, clear

# What can the coin flipping distribution do?

---

# 10 sets of 10 flips

![](4a_Distribution_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;


---

# flipping a coin 10 times

1. We expect to get 5 heads and 5 tails on average
2. But, we often do not get exactly 5 heads and 5 tails
3. Randomly sampling from the distribution can produce a variety of answers

---

# simulating 10 flips many times

Steps:

1. Flip a coin 10 times
2. count the number of heads, save the number
3. Repeat above 1,000 times or more
4. plot the histogram of number of heads

---

# Distribution of heads (10 flips)

![](4a_Distribution_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# Summary of simulation

1. Chance produces a range of outcomes (number of heads out of 10)

2. Chance most frequently produces 5 heads and 5 tails

3. Chance produces more extreme outcomes with increasingly less frequency (lower probability)

4. E.g., chance is very unlikely to produce 9 out of 10 heads

---

# flipping a coin 100 times

What if we simulated flipping a coin 100 times, what would the range of outcomes be?

# Distributions

---

# Distributions

1. A tool to define the chances of getting particular numbers
2. Distributions have shapes
3. Higher values indicate higher chance of getting a value

# Samples estimate the distribution

1. Samples are sets of numbers taken from a distribution

--

2. **Samples become more like the distribution they came from, as sample size (N) increases**

# Some questions

---

# Samples and distributions

How do samples relate to distributions?

--

  - Samples come from distributions
--

  - Samples approximate the distribution they came from as sample-size increases

---

# Is my sample likely?

Let's say you take a sample of numbers from a distribution.

1. Is your sample representative of the population?
2. Was your sample likely (you would usually get a sample like this), or unlikely (you got a weird sample, usually you would not get a sample like this)

---

# Simulation and sampling

How can we know if a sample we obtained is "normal", or "weird"?

--

- We can find out by simulating the process of sampling.
- We sample some numbers, measure the sample, then repeat
- We can now look at how our measurement of the sample behaves

---

# Animation of sample mean

![](figs/distribution/sampleHistUnif-1.gif)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# What to notice

- The histogram shows that each sample is different
- But, the mean of each sample is always around 5.5
- We have measured a property of the sample (the mean), each time.
