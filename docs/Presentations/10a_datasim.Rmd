# Overview

1. Power
2. Effect-size
3. Simulating data for a t-test for sample-size planning

# Experiment Design Question

I am planning to run an experiment, how many subjects do I need?

# Power and Effect-size

**Statistical Power**

- A property of designs. The likelihood that a design will detect a true effect when there is a true effect to be detected

**Effect size**

- Some measure of the size or magnitude of the effect in question

# Power

You will often see researchers conducting a power-analysis of their design **before** they conduct the research.

In a paper, they will report something like this:

"Our design needed an N of 50 to achieve power .8 to detect an effect of d=.5"

---

# Cohen's d

A standardized measure of effect-size

**Within-subject design**

$d= \frac{|u1 - u2|}{\text{sd}}$

**Between-subject design**

$d= \frac{|u1 - u2|}{\text{sd}_\text{pooled}}$

---

# Interpeting d

- d=0, no mean difference
- d=1, the difference between means is 1 sd
- d=2, the difference between means is 2 sds.

---

# What is a big or small d?

Conventional recommendations by Cohen:

- d = .2 (small)
- d = .5 (medium)
- d >= .8 (large)

---

# More interpretation of d

- Researchers should establish for themselves a minimum effect-size of interest.
- Minimum effect-size of interest depends on the research question

For example:

- d = .1, is small (and perhaps meaningless) if we are talking about whether a drug cures symptom like headache pain
- d = .1 is small (but meaningful) if we are using theories to test for the presence or absence of an effect

# Data-simulation

A process for simulating the results of an experiment

1. Useful for understanding the likely outcomes of a particular design
2. General method, can be applied to many kinds of designs
3. Useful for sample-size planning

1. Data simulation for ANOVAs
2. No quiz this week. We'll have the next one starting Tuesday
