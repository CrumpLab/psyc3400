There are three major lab assignments and a few smaller lab assignments, that are all described in the [Lab manual](https://github.com/CrumpLab/ResearchMethods/raw/master/LabManual/Lab_Manual.pdf). The details and expectations for the paper assignments will be posted here throughout the semester. During the lab you will be expected to complete 3 papers, and several lab projects that do not require full lab reports. For each paper, you will be required to write a complete APA style research report. The final paper involves two in class presentations: one individual presentation, and one group presentation.

Instructions for the three major paper projects are in the lab manual, and posted below:
