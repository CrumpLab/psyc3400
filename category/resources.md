PEEPs are a great way to learn about new research in Psychology. You can subscribe to PEEPs [here](http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/phase2/survey1/survey.htm?cid=jzmhxq&amp;1370375968).

## PsychoPy

[PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org) is a free open-source program that helps you build psychology experiments quickly and easily. It can be downloaded for Mac, PC, or Linux. Check out this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV6qhuQgsiI) on programming a simple Stroop experiment

## R and R-Studio

[R](http://www.r-project.org) is a free open-source programming language that can be used for statistical analysis, data-simulation, graphing, and lots of other stuff. Another free program is [R-studio](http://www.rstudio.com), that provides a nice graphic interface for R. Download R first, then download R-studio. Both can run on PCs, Macs or Linux. If you want a basic introduction to using R for stats, then check out my [textbook here](https://crumplab.github.io/ProgrammingTextbook/) (chapter 5 is most relevant, but chapter 4 gives some general R background).

## Google forms

Google forms is a free and user-friendly tool that can be used to conduct some kinds of simple experiments online. Google forms allows you to create questionnaire like polls, then send a link to have other people fill out answers to the questions. The responses are automatically stored in a google spreadsheet. [Here's a few tips on getting started.](https://crumplab.github.io/courses/experimentalFall2017/googleforms)
